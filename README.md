# Puzzle Universe (aka Nate's COMP 2522 Term Project)

As advertised (sort of)! Because sometimes you just need to guess colors, numbers, or words instead of doing actual work.

## 🤔 What's This Pile of Code?

Ever stare at a blinking cursor, knowing you *should* be productive, but your brain screams for a simple distraction? Did you perhaps see a dazzling advertisement for "**Puzzle Universe**" and wonder where such gaming marvels originated?

Well, you've found the source code! This repo contains a thrilling(?) collection of console-based games originally built for a BCIT COMP 2522 term project, now masquerading under a cooler name. It's got logic, it's got loops, it might even have a feature or two (bugs, probably). Mastermind, Number Guessing, Word Guessing – it's a veritable universe... of simple puzzles.

## ✨ "Features" That Barely Justify a Repo

*   **Triple Threat Gaming:** Mastermind, Number Guessing, *and* Word Guessing! Why build one game when you can build three slightly different ones? 🎲🔢🅰️
*   **Pure Console Action:** Forget fancy GUIs. We're kicking it old school with text-based interaction. Your terminal has never felt so alive!
*   **User Input Handling:** We *try* to gracefully handle whatever nonsense you type in. Try.
*   **Modular-ish Design:** There are interfaces and packages! It looks organized, which is half the battle.
*   **It Runs (Probably):** The ultimate feature of any student project.

## 🚀 Getting Distracted (Getting Started)

1.  **Clone this repo:** `git clone <your-repo-url>` (You know the drill)
2.  **Navigate to the source:** Find your way to the `src` directory. It's an adventure!
3.  **Compile the Java files:** You'll need a JDK. Fire up your terminal and run something like:
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS/WSL
    javac code/ca/bcit/comp2522/gameproject/*.java code/ca/bcit/comp2522/gameproject/mastermind/*.java code/ca/bcit/comp2522/gameproject/numbergame/*.java code/ca/bcit/comp2522/gameproject/wordgame/*.java code/ca/bcit/comp2522/gameproject/interfaces/*.java

    # On Windows Command Prompt (adjust paths if needed)
    # javac code\ca\bcit\comp2522\gameproject\*.java code\ca\bcit\comp2522\gameproject\mastermind\*.java code\ca\bcit\comp2522\gameproject\numbergame\*.java code\ca\bcit\comp2522\gameproject\wordgame\*.java code\ca\bcit\comp2522\gameproject\interfaces\*.java
    ```
    (Or just open it in your IDE, let's be real.)
4.  **Run the Main Launcher:**
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS/WSL
    java code.ca.bcit.comp2522.gameproject.Main

    # On Windows Command Prompt
    # java code.ca.bcit.comp2522.gameproject.Main
    ```
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts and enter the Puzzle Universe!

## 💭 Why Does This Exist?

*   It was a COMP 2522 term project requirement.
*   To demonstrate basic Java programming concepts.
*   Because writing games is objectively more fun than writing accounting software (probably).
*   Survival.
*   Needed something cool-sounding for an advertisement video ("Puzzle Universe"!).

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **Java:** The language that powers billions of devices and countless student projects.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA:** Because typing `javac` gets old, eventually.
*   **Coffee:** Copious amounts. ☕
*   **The Ghost of Deadlines Past:** Hauntingly effective motivation.
*   **Package Structure:** To give the illusion of grandeur.
